This is a sample usage of sshrc from https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc with oh-my-zsh stripped to only include the necessary stuff.

`.sshrc` was taken from here: https://github.com/oh-my-ssh/zsh

Install by including `bin/sshrc` in your PATH and moving `.sshrc` and `.sshrc.d` to your home folder.
